# Unplugged
Unplugged is a mobile application that displays South Africa load shedding schedules for areas specified by the user. The load shedding schedule for a paticular area on a paticular day is presented in a vertical 24 hour day timeline format (See 2nd screenshot). The total load shedding (downtime) for a paticular day is calculated and displayed alongside the schedule. A user can add and remove areas for which they wish to receive load shedding schedules.

## Note From the Dev
The creation of this application was intended to be a learning exercise. The objectives of this exercise were to improve my understanding of asynchronous app development, working with a remote API, and learing good app architecture.
